# Dunst Timer

A timer which is displayed as a dunst notification

## Motivation

A few weeks ago a great project appeared on Reddit and other platforms:
[mpris-timer](https://github.com/efogdev/mpris-timer)

A simple timer which uses the MPRIS interface to display a timer as a notification. I really liked the idea and wanted to create a similar application which uses the dunst notification system, because different window managers and desktop environments use different styles of a bar so maybe a media-styled notification would not fit in every environment.

## Features & Usage

Emojis are supported too üòç

```bash
python dunst-timer.py -d 10m -t "A 10 minute timer üíº "
```

or if the application is installed

```bash
dunst-timer -d 10m
```

The timer is blocking, so you can't use the terminal until the timer is finished. If you want to run the timer in the background you can use the `&` operator

```bash
dunst-timer -d 10m &
```

**Full Spec**
```bash
Usage: dunst-timer [-t TITLE] -d DURATION [-p]
Run a timer with notifications.
  -t, --title       Title of the timer (default: 'Timer')
  -d, --duration    Duration of the timer (e.g., '1h5m8s' or 'HH:MM:SS')
  -p, --percentage  Print the percentage of the timer
  -h, --help        Print this help message
```

## Installation

### Arch User Repository

The application is available in the AUR as `dunst-timer`

    ```bash
    yay -S dunst-timer
    ```

### Manual Installation

On any other system you can install the application by cloning the repository and copying the script to `/usr/bin` (or any other directory in your `$PATH`)

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bitSheriff/dunst-timer.git
    cd dunst-timer
    cp dunst-timer.py /usr/bin/dunst-timer
    chmod +x /usr/bin/dunst-timer
```
