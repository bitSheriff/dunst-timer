# Dunst Timer

A timer which is displayed as a dunst notification

## Motivation

A few weeks ago a great project appeared on Reddit and other platforms:
[mpris-timer](https://github.com/efogdev/mpris-timer)

A simple timer which uses the MPRIS interface to display a timer as a notification. I really liked the idea and wanted to create a similar application which uses the dunst notification system, because different window managers and desktop environments use different styles of a bar so maybe a media-styled notification would not fit in every environment.

## Features & Usage

Emojis are supported too. 

```bash
python dunst-timer.py -d 10m -t "A 10 minute timer ðŸ’¼ "
```

or if the application is installed

```bash
dunst-timer -d 10m
```

The timer is blocking, so you can't use the terminal until the timer is finished. If you want to run the timer in the background you can use the `&` operator

```bash
dunst-timer -d 10m &
```

## Installation

### Arch User Repository

The application is available in the AUR as `dunst-timer`

    ```bash
    yay -S dunst-timer
    ```

### Manual Installation

On any other system you can install the application by cloning the repository and copying the script to `/usr/bin` (or any other directory in your `$PATH`)

`bash
    git clone https://github.com/bitSheriff/dunst-timer.git
    cd dunst-timer
    cp dunst-timer.py /usr/bin/dunst-timer
    chmod +x /usr/bin/dunst-timer
    `
